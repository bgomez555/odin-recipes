    <h1>Chicken Cordon Bleu</h1>
    <h2>A simple take on a French classic</h2>

    <p>A cordon bleu is a dish that traditionally consists of meat wrapped around cheese, then breaded and pan-fried or deep-fried. Many modern versions of the classic French recipe, such as this one, are baked.</p>

    <p>"Cordon bleu" translates to "blue ribbon." According to Larousse Gastronomique, a French food encyclopedia, the phrase dates back to medieval times when the most prestigious order a knight could earn was called the Cross of the Holy Spirit. The honor was signified by a medal that hung from a blue ribbon known as Le Cordon Bleu. Over time, the blue ribbon became a symbol of excellence. The term, meanwhile, became associated with food that meets the highest of standards or that is prepared by the most prestigious chefs.</p>
